TASK#1-: Analysed the given titanic dataset and performed data cleaning and classification on the given dataset by identifying and removing missing values in the data and present some meaningful observations. Relevant python libraries are used to get useful visualisation and data insights.

TASK#2-: The given iris dataset is being analysed by removing duplicates along with null values to make sure the data is fully cleaned. After data cleaning, Data Visualization is performed using the Histogram to know the distribution of data in the given dataset, plotting sepal length & width and petal length & width to know about the pattern and behaviour of the iris dataset attributes.

TASK#3-: Created a Bank Data Financial Analysis Dashboard providing the overview of financial performance and key metrics for a bank. The main sections of the report cover various aspects of financial analysis, including revenue analysis, expense analysis, profitability analysis, asset quality analysis, and liquidity analysis. Each section provides a detailed breakdown of key metrics and trends, allowing users to identify areas of strength and areas that require attention.

*The revenue analysis section highlights the bank's sources of revenue, such as interest income, fee income, and non-interest income. Users can explore revenue trends over time and analyze the contribution of different revenue streams to the bank's overall financial performance.

*The expense analysis section focuses on different categories of expenses, such as personnel expenses, operating expenses, and provisions for loan losses. Users can analyze expense ratios, compare actual expenses to budgeted expenses, and identify opportunities for cost optimization.

*The profitability analysis section evaluates the bank's profitability metrics, such as net interest margin, return on assets, and return on equity. Users can assess the bank's ability to generate profits and compare its performance with industry benchmarks.
